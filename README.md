# Search Images
This is a tiny project created by me for learning purposes.
Checkout the website at [search-images](https://heikrana.github.io/search-images/)

## What it does...
You can search images by keywords, Unspash.com's API is used to provide search results and this whole program is created with ReactJS.

## Other *fine details*
I have hard coded to show 25 images (in the next version there will be a **load more** button).

Also, to leave the minimum spaces between images with different height and width, I'm using CSS span property with span elements of size 10px.

## Note from **ME**
You can make changes to the code (obviously, it's open source, you can do whatever you want) but if you do change the code and add new features or fix the old ones, do let me know (maybe share your own repository) and we'll code together :)
